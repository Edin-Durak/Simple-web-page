# Simple-web-page
A simple web page was created using HTML and CSS, featuring a responsive design for all screen sizes.
This web page was requested by a client on Upwork.
The client provided the styling and responsiveness requirements for all screens. 
I added box-shadowing to the images and paragraphs to enhance the visual appearance.


Look of the page on the desktop bellow:
